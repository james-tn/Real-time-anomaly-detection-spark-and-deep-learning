1. data can be transformed to tables by these .py files
2. run "transform_data.py" will execute all other .py files

3. One major problem: the last row in .py files: 
  results.rdd.saveAsTextFile('hdfs:///user/w205/final/xbarm.txt')
cannot output regular .txt files with data. Please help me to figure it out.
